## Assignment: Implement all models!

This directory contains two datasets:

1. **Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling**: This dataset is an excellent example for determining whether a client or customer is eligible for a loan. It involves a binary classification problem. Using this dataset, I developed models including **Decision Tree, K-means, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network**.

2. **GDPIndia**: This dataset illustrates India's GDP in trillions from 1960 to 2017. I utilized this data to train an **ARIMA model** for time series forecasting.
